What Is AutoML in Python?

AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, simplifies the process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It automates the tedious process of selecting and optimizing machine learning models, eliminating the need for extensive domain knowledge.

Instead of manually experimenting with various algorithms and their hyperparameters, practitioners can use AutoML tools to find optimal solutions more efficiently. Python, being a leading programming language in data science and machine learning, offers several AutoML libraries.

These libraries vary in their approach to automating the machine learning pipeline, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. They aim to make machine learning more accessible and accelerate the development of models.
